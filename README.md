helix.go is the Go implementation of [helix](https://github.com/nunchistudio/helix),
for building cloud-native, consistent, reliable, and high-performance (micro)
services. It allows back-end engineers to simplify development of complex problems
through a thin layer of abstraction that handles automatic logging, tracing,
observability, and event propagation across services and integrations.
