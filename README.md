# helix.go

helix.go is the Go implementation of [helix](https://github.com/nunchistudio/helix).

helix.go was developed with the following use cases in mind:

- Consistent and high-performance (micro) services;
- Effortless end-to-end observability and event tracking across services.

By using helix.go, organizations can benefit from automatic distributed tracing,
error recording, and event propagation across Go services and integrations with
no additional lines of code!
